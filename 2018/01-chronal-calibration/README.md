Day 1: Chronal Calibration

https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1

A:
The device shows a sequence of changes in frequency (your puzzle
input). A value like +6 means the current frequency increases by 6; a
value like -3 means the current frequency decreases by 3.

B:
You notice that the device repeats the same frequency change list
over and over. To calibrate the device, you need to find the first
frequency it reaches twice.

Sample input:
```
-17
-20
-15
-2
-7
-4
-18
-7
-5
-6
```

Benchmark:
```
