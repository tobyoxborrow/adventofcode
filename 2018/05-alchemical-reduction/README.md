# Day 5: Alchemical Reduction

https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/5

## Challenges
You scan the chemical composition of the suit's material and discover that it is formed by extremely long polymers (one of which is available as your puzzle input).

* A: How many units remain after fully reacting the polymer you scanned?
* B: What is the length of the shortest polymer you can produce by removing all units of exactly one type and fully reacting the result?
