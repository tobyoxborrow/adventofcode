# Day 3: Gear Ratios

https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3

## Challenges
The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don't really understand, but apparently any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a "part number" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (.) do not count as a symbol.)

* One: What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?
* Two: What is the sum of all of the gear ratios in your engine schematic?
