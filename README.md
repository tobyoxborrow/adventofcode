# Advent of Code solutions

> Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.

The code contained here is complete enough to solve the challenges, it does not
necessarily follow best practicies or meet style guidelines.
